Raytracer written in V for my Facharbeit

# Todo
- [ ] Fix ambient lighting bug?
- [ ] Fix FOV issue and camera placement

# Shapes and Bodies to Add
- Donut
- Planes
    - SPHERICAL!!!! plane
    - Quads (basically viereck)
    - I guess I can go on with other 2d Shapes


Strategy:
    Do as much work as possible now.
    Present it to Herr Bachmann.
    Figure out what makes the most sense to put in the Facharbeit.
